        <h4>What could be better than enjoying the sights and sounds of the Italian capital before gorging on some seriously delicious pizza?</h4>
        <p> 
          Asking where to eat the best pizza in Rome is a question fraught with debate, but the good news is there are plenty of options. 
          Do you prefer the Neapolitan style? Or maybe the Roman version? Everyone has their opinion, but the taste buds are the real winners.
          <p>In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.
          Rome is packed with delicious pizzerias in which to get your fill, whether you are after a slice, a whole pie or even a pinsa, an oval-shaped pie with its own quirks that might raise the whole thing to a new level. Delicious, delicious, delicious.
          Pizza was invented in Naples and it was considered a poor persons food. There was little progress with the quality and ingredients for over 100 years. 
          Upon entering Quatro Pizza, you will be presented with a rainbow of color, as well as ingredients and combinations you would never imagine on a pizza. 
          Everything about the pizza al taglio at pizzarium is high quality. </p>
          Bonci uses the an organic wheat flour called Mulino Marino, made in a piedmont based mill that stone grinds heritage grains. 
          The pizza dough undergoes a fermentation process of 72-hours, before being baked and toppings added. 
          This creates light, airy and crispy base, yet slightly chewy with the perfect crunch. 
          The toppings used are fresh, locally sourced, in-season ingredients. 
          Bonci has created over 1500 different pizza recipes, including many vegan and vegetarian options. Itâ€™s almost impossible to predict the daily pizza on offer. 
          Unfortunately there are no gluten-free pizza options, however head down to his bakery for Celiac-friendly alternatives.
          His one rule is to use a maximum of three toppings per pizza. More than 3, the balance is lost and the flavors struggle to compliment each other.
